# 🏃‍♂️ React Native Fitness Tracker App

A cloud-based fitness tracking application built using **React Native**, **AWS**, and **IoT sensors** for real-time body monitoring. Developed as part of my BSc final year project, this app demonstrates the integration of mobile interfaces, cloud services, and physical devices to track and visualise live health data.
